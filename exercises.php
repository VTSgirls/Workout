  <h1><u>Exercises</u></h1>
<h2 id="chest">Chest</h2>
<p>1. <u>Bench exercises with a barbell</u><br><br>
It is recommended that you do them at your own pace,<br>
without pressure and excessive beginner requirements.<br>
Also, coaches recommend that you keep your hands away from shoulder width <br>
  when lifting the barbell to protect your shoulders.<br>
It is very important that this exercise is performed correctly in order to have<br>
  the greatest effect on the triceps, shoulders, and thus the whole chest. <br>
  If your feet are firmly on the ground, it means you are doing the right thing. <br>
</p>

<br><br>
<p>2. <u>Decay exercises</u><br><br>
Ideal exercises for both the lower and upper chest. <br>
Proper use of the shaft achieves the greatest effect<br>
  on the shape of the chest, leg, arm and neck muscles. <br>
It is important that your legs are crossed behind you during the exercise,<br>
  and that you transfer all your strength to your arms. <br>
Certainly, proper inhalations and exhalations are inevitable, <br>
  and it is recommended that you take short breaks between series of "failures."<br>

<br><br>
<p>3. <u>Push-ups</u><br><br>
When doing push-ups, the body is facing the ground in a horizontal position. <br>
Hands should be at shoulder level, palms facing up. <br>
The legs are slightly spread. <br>
From the heel to the nape of the neck, the body should be straight,<br>
ie. there should be no bending of the body at the knees or hips. <br>
</p>

<br><br>
<h2 id="shoulders">Shoulders</h2>
<p>1.<u>Standing thrust with rod</u><br><br>
The grip must be wider than shoulder width, slightly bent at the knees. <br>
Take the bar and lift it to the shoulder area. <br>
Tighten the gluteus to be firmer when performing the exercise. <br>
Push your hips to the back and use that force to push the bar over your head. <br>
</p>
<br><br>
<p>2.<u>Cable shoulder exercises</u> <br><br>
This multifunctional device that is ideal for all muscle groups, <br>
  and is also great for forming shoulder muscles. <br>
Stand in front of the cable, hands, holding the cable bar, <br>
keep open towards yourself or inwards and slowly raise at shoulder height. <br>
The most ideal pose is one in which you are a little away from the device. <br>
Repeat this exercise depending on your weight.<br>

<h2 id="biceps">Biceps</h2>
<p>1. <u>Fold with dumbbells</u><br><br>
Standing position with arms lowered along the body. <br>
Take the dumbbells in your hands and lower them on your hips. <br>
By contracting the biceps, we raise the dumbbells alternately to the level of the shoulder joint. <br>
Let's keep at the top of the movement hands for a few seconds and return them to the starting position. <br>

<p>2. <u>Biceps flexion on Scott's bench</u><br><br>
Sitting or standing. His hands are resting on Scott's bench, and the end of the bench is under his armpits. <br>
  We hold the bar in our hands. Raise the bar to chin level. Exhaling by exhaling. <br>
  With the inhale, we slowly return our hands to the starting position. <br>
</p>
<br><br>
<p>3. <u>Concentration biceps flexion</u><br><br>
  Sitting on a flat bench, rest your elbow on your knee. <br>
  Hold the dumbbell down in your hand. With an isolated contraction of the biceps, <br>
  we lift the dumbbell upwards and the shoulder.<br>
  As we lift it up, we exhale. Then we return to the starting position. <br>

<br><br>
<p>2. <u>Decay on a flat bench</u><br><br>
  This exercise is great for those who are new to triceps training and can be performed anywhere. <br>
  You need any piece of furniture in the house, and it is important that it is solid and stable. <br>
  Grasp the edge of the bench with your legs outstretched so that your heels touch the floor. <br>
  Bend your arms so that your triceps are parallel to the floor. <br>
  Then, extend your arms and return to the starting position. <br>
</p>
<br><br>
<p>3. <u>Pushing the triceps back</u><br><br>
  This exercise is done on a sloping bench and is very effective. <br>
  Make sure your feet are firmly on the ground and with each repetition. <br>
  The upper arms must be immobile and placed close to the body. <br>
</p>

<h2 id="forearms">Forearms</h2>
<p>1. <u>Exercises with a wrist roller</u><br><br>
  Grasp the bar at chest width and move slightly away from the body. <br>
  Rotate the bar with one hand and the other, twisting the wrist. <br>
</p>
<br><br>
<p>2. <u>Endurance with forearm plates</u><br><br>
  With your fingers, take two plates of equal thickness, hold the edge, <br>
  with your thumb on one side, and with the other fingers on the other. <br>
  Fix the upper arm with the body slightly moved backwards, <br>
  bend the elbow slightly, and fix the forearm in the plane of the waist. <br>
</p>
<img src="Images/photo-1613845205719-8c87760ab728.jpg" height="350px" width="auto">
<br><br>
<p>3. <u>Sitting flexion and extension of the hand with dumbbells on the side</u><br><br>
  Sitting at the end of the bench to catch a couple of dumbbells. <br>
  Hands hang on each side of the body. <br>
  The wrists should rotate over and the elbows should bend, with the club head bring behind. <br>
  Raise the weights with your fists and then lower them slowly. <br>
</p>
<br><br>
<h2 id="abdomen">Abdomen</h2>
<p>1. <u>Crunches</u><br><br>
  Lie on the floor and bend your legs at the knees. Put your hands behind your head. <br>
  Raise your upper body and knees at the same time, then return slightly to your original position. <br>
  When you get up then exhale, and when you return to the starting position, then inhale. <br>
</p>
<img src="Images/jonathan-borba-lrQPTQs7nQQ-unsplash.jpg" height="350px" width="auto">
<br><br>
<p>2. <u>Scissors</u><br><br>
  Lie on the floor with your legs outstretched. The hands are next to the body. <br>
  Slowly lift your legs off the floor and cross them, left over right, and vice versa. <br>
  At the same time, the shoulders are raised off the floor. <br>
  For the heavier variant, keep your feet closer to the floor, but be careful not to lift your lower back off the floor. <br>
  If you want a lighter variant, raise your legs a little higher than the floor. <br>
</p>
<br><br>
<p>3. <u>Plank</u><br><br>
  When doing planks, the shoulders should be just above the elbows. <br>
  The back is completely straight, the hips should not be too high, but the body is in one plane. <br>
  The feet are hip-width apart and the abdomen is tight. <br>
</p>
<img src="Images/sergio-pedemonte-bmy4kUG4n3M-unsplash.jpg" height="350px" width="auto">
<br><br>
<h2 id="back">Back</h2>
<p>1. <u>Deadlift</u><br><br>
  The hands are used only to hold the bar, while the whole work is done by the back, which must remain straight. <br>
  The support is on the heels and the bar is raised until you are in an upright position. <br>
</p>
<img src="Images/photo-1566241142404-6c2bb4201a30.jpg" height="350px" width="auto">
<br><br>
<p>2. <u>Joints</u><br><br>
  This exercise is performed in two ways:<br>
  with the fists facing the bar (outside) or towards the bar (inside). <br>
  Exercise affects the so-called fan muscles, <br>
  and the first sign that you are not doing the exercise properly is a feeling of pain in the biceps. <br>
  The most important thing when performing, is to work the whole joint from the elbow, not from the fist. <br>
  The legs are crossed at the back. <br>
</p>
<img src="Images/photo-1434656742621-5c4a7d73d0e7.jpg" height="350px" width="auto">
<br><br>
<p>3. <u>Back stretching exercises</u><br><br>
  These are exercises that you can do outside the gym, <br>
  but also in the gym with the help of a ball or alone, without aids. <br>
  They are actually very simple, and if you suffer from lower back pain, they can be extremely effective. <br>
  It is important that you do not overload yourself. <br>
</p>
<img src="Images/alexandra-tran-RO_2mMUINe4-unsplash.jpg" height="350px" width="auto">
<br><br>
<h2 id="thighs">Thighs</h2>
<p>1. <u>Squat</u><br><br>
  Stand in an upright standing position with palms on your hips. Feet shoulder-width apart. <br>
  The arms can also be crossed with the palms on the chest. <br>
  Bending at the knee joints and slightly at the hip joints, <br>
  lower yourself until your thighs are at least parallel to the ground. <br>
  Stretching at the knees and hips, return to the starting position. <br>
</p>
<img src="Images/meghan-holmes-wy_L8W0zcpI-unsplash.jpg" height="350px" width="auto">
<br><br>
<p>2. <u>Donkey shot</u><br><br>
  Take a four-legged position, leaning on your knees and hands.<br>
  Bend one leg at the knee and lift until the thighs are flush with the hips. <br>
  When you get to this position, <br>
  lift your leg in short movements upwards about 30 times, <br>
  so turn your knee outwards so that your thighs are at right angles to your hips<br>
  and lift your leg in short strokes in the same way. <br>
</p>
<img src="Images/wesley-tingey-v-9dL7cAyRM-unsplash.jpg" height="350px" width="auto">
<br><br>
<p>3. <u>Side step</u><br><br>
  A very effective exercise that brings fast results. <br>
  Starting position - stand up straight, then step out with one foot and do a deep squat. <br>
</p>
<br><br>
<h2 id="calves">Calves</h2>
<p>1. <u>Exercise with elastic bands</u><br><br>
  Sit on a mat with your legs outstretched. Then bend one at the knee, <br>
  and rest the other foot on the elastic band you previously tightened with both hands. <br>
  Now all you have to do is resist your leg with the straps, and don't bend your leg at the knee at any point. <br>
You should feel tension in the area of the leaves all the time, but also in the back box. <br>
</p>

<br><br>
<p>2. <u>Lifting on toes</u><br><br>
Stand up straight, connect your legs at the feet - your knees are straight at all times. <br>
From this position you rise to your toes. <br>
This exercise is very important for strengthening and tightening this muscle group. <br>
  If you are in good shape, you can do it with a load - with weights. <br>
</p>
<img src="Images/oleksandr-koval-eo6V_BA0s5w-unsplash.jpg" height="350px" width="auto">
<br><br>
<p>3. <u>Skipping rope</u><br><br>
Skipping the rope activates all the muscles of your body, great for shaping leaves. <br>
  For stronger effects, set aside 5 to 10 minutes of your time in each workout. <br>
Start slowly at first, then increase the pace. The results will not be missed. <br>
